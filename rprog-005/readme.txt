This folder contains assigntment for the JHU coureara course on R Programming. the "005" is a versioning scheme to track the classes. Hence, this is the 5th time they've given the class, and I am in that installment...

I had to create this folder as part of my assignments to upload my answer. 

Creating a readme file is also a shortcut to creating a folder though the git web interface... I thought I would try it out :-)
