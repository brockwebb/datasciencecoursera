## Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related 
## sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# "vehicle" to search for...

# This takes us back to plot1.R, where I can just use the plot() function to 
# display the data, but just use "sccnei.vehicle" instead...

# Summarize the data into a neat table, there are probably lots of ways
# to do this, ddply as discussed in the lectures has a lot of power.
# This essentially follows plot3.R from here... (but on City, not type)
