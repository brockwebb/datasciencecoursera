## Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related 
## sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

#Loading the data
# These take awhile to load, if I've already done that in my R environment,
# check to see, it is a convenient time saver if you are itterating on exploring the data

}

# Merge the SCC data with the NEI data, this will add the description (which will 
# include "coal") this step can take a really (I mean *really*) long time 
# on my old 2008 powerbook...
if (!exists('sccnei')) {
       sccnei <- merge(NEI,SCC,by='SCC')
}

# Retrieve just the vehicle related data from the merged table
# I had to look at the data to find that the SCC.Level.Two field contained a reliable
# "vehicle" to search for...
sccnei.vehicle = sccnei[grepl("vehicle", sccnei$SCC.Level.Two,ignore.case=TRUE),]

# Now subset the data for Baltimore City
sccnei.vehicle.BaltimoreCityMD <- subset(sccnei.vehicle, fips==24510)

# This takes us back to plot1.R, where I can just use the plot() function to 
# display the data, but just use "sccnei.vehicle" instead...

# Summarize the data into a neat table, there are probably lots of ways
# to do this, ddply as discussed in the lectures has a lot of power
summary_data <- ddply(sccnei.vehicle.BaltimoreCityMD, 'year', summarize, tot=sum(Emissions))

# The basic plot with labels. For bonus points, I added a linear with a linear regression.
